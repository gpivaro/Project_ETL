What useful investigation could be done with the final database?
The Wikipedia gives us a list of the Company names, sector and tickers. We can use this to go and get more information on the Yahoo finance side to get the stock prices to analyze how the sector is performing during a set time frame.

Whether final database will be relational or non-relational. Why?
We will be using a relational database because our information is very structured and additionally we have access to a cloud MySQL so that we can all access the database.
